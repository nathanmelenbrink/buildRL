		<p>Initially, this project was not meant to be a game, but a simulation tool. I had been working on an independent study at GSD where I was researching multi-agent behavior and coding in C# using a library called Millipede for finite element calculations. My initial proposal was to translate this into visual studio to make a front-end and a way of automating and varying the simulations. However, I realized this would require shader programming in GL, and I didn't really want to produce a standalone. So I decided instead to rewrite the code in JS and make it into a game. This way it would be more accessible to more people.
		</p>

		<p>While my previous work in C# had relied on a library for structural analysis, I didn't have that in JS. So I wrote my own function for very simplified spring-model type physical analysis. So struts turn red when they're compressed, and blue when they're in tension. This is the main engine that drives the game.  
		</p>

		<p>In addition to vanilla JS, I used p5 (Processing for JS) and p5.play extension for rendering and sprite control. I cited a function I found online that overcomes a permissions error when loading images in p5. All other code was written by myself. Some elements of the code, especially the data inheritance for the behavior classes, are based on advice from my GSD independent study adviser Panagiotis Michalatos. However, this was in C# and using libraries - it required significant rewriting and restructuring for its current state. 
		</p>

		<p>Under the hood are a series of "classes", or objects as JS doesn't have classes. These include the Truss, Node, Edge, and Agent objects, as well as a Behavior class, and subclasses (inherited from Behavior) BuildUp, WalkDown, and Reinforce. The Truss class is the driving engine - it contains and manages all the references to other objects. The Truss itself is composed of Nodes and Edges. At each frame, the structural forces are evaluation and positions of each element are updated. But only every 5 frames (by default, this is what the speed parameter controls) do the bots reach a new position, evaluate whether or not to keep moving, add a strut, etc.
