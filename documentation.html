		<p>Builder Bots is a browser-based game. Playing the game is as easy as heading to <a href="https://github.com/nathanmelenbrink/builder-bots/tree/gh-pages">Builder Bots</a>
		</p>

		<p>Youtube documentation is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVYr5qTGLyQ">Builder Bots</a>

		</p>

		<p>You will be greeted by a page with instructions for the game. At first, you may or may not choose to specify parameters. If you don't default values will be provided for you. Click on the canvas to begin. You will then see a swarm of builder bots begin to emerge from the start point. The objective of the game, of course, is to get to the target point. It might be interesting just to watch at first, but without any action from the user, the structure will fail. The user's only allowed input is to click on the bots to change their behaviors. By default, the bots will cycle through a "build toward point" behavior and a "return home" behavior. In other words, the bots return home to retreive a new strut, then move up the structure until they get as close to the target point as they can (with some randomness embedded for variety). They deposit the strut, automatically switch their behavior to "return home" and go for it again. This alone will result in porous, unstable structures. In order to win the game, the user must convert some of the bots to become "reinforcers", infilling the structure to make it more stable. 
		</p>

		<p>The game is won when a strut is placed within one strut-length of the target point.  The game is lost when the maxStress value of one or more of the struts is reached, signifying structural failure. Only a well-made structure will be able to reach the target point before it fails.

		<p>If you are finding the game to be either too challenging or too easy, try editing the parameters on the start screen to vary the level of difficulty.
